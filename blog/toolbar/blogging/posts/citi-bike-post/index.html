      	<p><a href = "https://www.citibikenyc.com/about"> Citi Bike</a> is New York City's bike sharing system instituted by Citi Bank and operated by <a href = "http://www.motivateco.com/"> Motivate</a>. The bike sharing system is designed to provide New Yorkers an additional method of transportation around the city. As a whole the system is fairly simple to understand: there is a fleet of bicycles that can be rented from and then returned to any of the hundreds of docking stationsin the city. As of May 2013 Citi had installed 332 docking stations and stocked them with 6,000 bikes. Plans were made for expansion but I could not find any publicly released data on the current number of stations or bikes. </p>
      	<p>This project started as a way to begin learning to work with the Python <a href = "http://pandas.pydata.org/" >Pandas</a> library. Over the past summer after working with the Javascript <a href = "">D3</a> library I was hooked on data visualizations and looking for another project that would allow me to create another nice looking visual. Luckily for me Citi has made their data public <a href = "https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data">here</a>. In my rush to produce I decided to only work with the data from July 2013...obviously this was a beginner mistake because there is data from as recently as September of this year now. Perhaps at some point in the future I'll revise this project to represent the data from each of the available months.</p>
