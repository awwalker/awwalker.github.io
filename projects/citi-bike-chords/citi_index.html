   <h1> Bike the City with Citi </h1>
   <h2> How do New Yorkers use Citi Bikes?</h2>
   <h3> ~Hover over a bike station to see its common routes or a strand to see the amount of trips between two stations~</h3>
   <div class = 'guide'id = 'guide_overall'>
      <p>
         <a href="http://www.citibikenyc.com/">Citi bike</a> provides New Yorkers and visitors with a convenient and efficient alternative transportation option. There are hundreds of <a href="https://member.citibikenyc.com/map/">stations</a> and thousands of bikes available 24 hours a day 7 days a week. 
      </p></br>

         Obviously not all the stations are represented in this diagram. In order to present a clean diagram I had to reduce the number of stations. You can check out the associated blog post <a href = "">here</a> to see the code / reasoning behind this simplification if it interests you, or just take my word that these 17 stations were the most widely used during the month of July, 2013.
