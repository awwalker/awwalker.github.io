        <h1>Aaron Walker</h1>
         <h3>Young Programmer just trying to learn.</h3>
          <p>I am a third year undergrad at NYU studying Computer Science and Economics. I grew up in California’s Bay Area in a small town called Los Gatos, spending my time running and surfing. I decided to go to college in New York to experience the fast-paced lifestyle of a city and to expose myself to more of what the world has to offer. Originally my plan was to study Behavioral Economics and graduate from NYU with a degree in Economics.  However, during my first year at school my interests shifted from running to rock climbing, and from Behavioral Economics to Computer Science and programming. Now my plan is to graduate with a joint degree in both Computer Science and Economics. 
          </p> 
         <p>Computer Science had never been something that I was extremely interested in before my first semester at NYU, and if it weren’t for a friend who took a Python course at UC Davis I probably would’ve never tried it. While my friend was taking the class she complained endlessly about the workload and difficulty of the material, but all I was interested in was how cool the end products she was creating were. My next semester I enrolled in a Python class myself, and programming quickly became an obsession of mine.
        </p>
        <p>I currently work with Python and Java and am most interested in server side programming, though I’m also picking up pieces of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. To see some of the final products / visualizations I have created check out the Projects tab above, or if you’d like to see the code / thought process / more background check out the Blog tab.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!
