    <p>We add a delay so that the servo motor can finish accomplishing the current requested rotation before receiving the next signal to rotate. Since 0 degrees -> 1.25 milliseconds and 180 degrees -> 1.75 milliseconds then 45 degrees -> 1.375 milliseconds. Since both the servo motor and speaker use something similar to pulse width modulation the sginal cannot be exchanged between both at the same time.</p>
