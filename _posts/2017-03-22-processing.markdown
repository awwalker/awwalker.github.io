    <p> Processing is based on Java. Global variables are accessible anywhere within a program whereas local variables are only accessible within the scopes that define them. The draw() function returns nothing, the void type, when it is called. The "//keep circle in bounds" code reverses the movement of the cirlce so that when it touches the edge of the background it starts moving in the opposite dirction.</p>
